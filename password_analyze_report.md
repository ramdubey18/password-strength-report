Objective: To understand what makes a password strong by creating multiple passwords, testing them using an online strength checker, and summarizing best practices.



**1.** **Introduction**



Passwords are the first line of defense against unauthorized access. Weak passwords can be guessed or cracked easily, while strong passwords make it significantly harder for attackers. This report evaluates multiple passwords, records their strength scores, and outlines best practices.





**2. Create multiple passwords with varying complexity.**



Use uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols, and length variations.



Test each password on a password strength checker.



Note scores and feedback from the tool.



Identify best practices for creating strong passwords.



Write down tips learned from the evaluation.



Research common password attacks (brute force, dictionary).



Summarize how password complexity affects security.



Outcome: Understanding password security and best practices.





**3. Methodology**



**Tool Used:** passwordmeter.com



***Process:***



Created multiple passwords with varying complexity and length.



Tested each password using the tool.



Recorded the scores and feedback.



Analyzed the effect of complexity on score.





**4. Password Test Results**

###### 

###### ***Password	        Score (%)	Complexity	   Key Feedback***

password	                 5%	             Very Weak	      Only lowercase letters, easy to guess

pass1234	                32%	               Weak	      Predictable numbers, short length

PaSs1234	                58%	             Moderate	      Mixed case, short length

Pa$$w0rd2025            	82%	              Strong	      Mixed characters, but still dictionary-based

\[Hidden] (Screenshot)   	99%	            Very Strong       Long length, mixed case, numbers, symbols, variety





###### **5. Detailed Breakdown for 99% Password**



**Additions:**



Number of characters: 12 -> +48 points



Uppercase letters: 1 -> +22 points



Lowercase letters: 7 -> +10 points



Numbers: 3 -> +12 points



Symbols: 1 -> +6 points



Middle numbers or symbols: 4 -> +8 points



Met minimum requirements: 5/4 categories -> +10 points





**Deductions:**



Consecutive lowercase letters: -10 points



Consecutive numbers: -4 points



Sequential numbers: -3 points





###### 6\. Analysis



Short passwords with only letters scored poorly due to lack of variety. Including uppercase letters, numbers, and symbols increased the score significantly. The top scoring password had a good length, diverse characters, and avoided predictable patterns.





###### 7\. Best Practices for Strong Passwords



Use at least 12-16 characters.



Include uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols.



Avoid common words and predictable sequences.



Use random patterns rather than personal information.



Create unique passwords for each account.



Use a password manager for convenience and security.

###### 



###### 8\. Common Password Attacks



Brute Force: Tries all possible combinations.



Dictionary Attack: Uses a list of common words and phrases.



Phishing: Tricks the user into revealing their password via fake sites.



9\. Effect of Complexity on Security

Long and complex passwords are exponentially harder to crack. An 8-character password with only letters can be cracked in seconds, while a 16-character password with mixed characters may take millions of years.



10\. Conclusion

Testing confirmed that long, complex, and random passwords achieve higher scores and are far more secure. The 99% password demonstrated the ideal mix of length, variety, and unpredictability. Adopting these practices greatly reduces the risk of account compromise.
